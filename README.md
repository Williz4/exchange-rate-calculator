## Description

A simple Currency Exchange Calculator built with HTML, CSS & JS using the fetch api from https://app.exchangerate-api.com/.

## How To Interact with the Application
* The site is currently hosted with github using the url https://williz4.github.io/exchange-rate-calculator/

* You can select the first currency and the second currency and the calculator will be able to return the rate of the two currencies
* The swap button has an event listener added to it so incase someone clicks on it we are able to swap the values between the first and second currency fields.

## Known  Bugs
Currently there are no known bugs in the Currency Exchange Calculator

## Technologies Used
I used HTML for the sites structure and CSS for the styling and visual presentation and finally JS using the fetch api to get data from the exchange rate api for functionality.
